Goal: Analyze the provided source materials for a specific subject (e.g., History, Physics, Literature) and create a structured, detailed, step-by-step study plan broken down into thematic modules.

Part 1: Resource Categorization & Curation
Before executing this prompt, the user will upload the files and conceptually categorize them.

Mainline/Core Resources (MUST be fully covered):

(List all essential lecture notes, required readings, slides, etc., here.)

Conditional/Supplemental Resources (USE SELECTIVELY):

(List large textbooks, optional articles, or background reading here.)

Instructions for Conditional Resources:

Book/File 1 (e.g., Large Textbook): Only use content from specified page ranges, if any.

Book/File 2 (e.g., Reference Book): Only use content that directly supports, clarifies, or elaborates on concepts already present in the Mainline/Core Resources. Do not introduce new, non-essential topics.

Part 2: Study Session Structure and Workflow
Task: Break the entire subject material down into coherent, logical thematic chunks based on topic overlap and structure.

Initial Output Request:

Analyze the Mainline/Core Resources (and the topic names from the Supplemental Files).

Propose a list of 5-8 logical Thematic Chunks for this subject.

Workflow (Sequential Execution): Once the chunks are approved, we will address each Thematic Chunk separately and sequentially in our chat.

For each individual chunk, you must:

Identify and cite all relevant pages/sections from the Mainline/Core Resources.

Integrate and synthesize supporting information from the Conditional Resources (strictly adhering to the rules in Part 1).

Provide a comprehensive, detailed breakdown of the topic. Ensure ALL details and facts from the Mainline/Core Resources are included and properly covered in the summary for that chunk.
