Interactive MCQ Study Game Generator

1. Data Source & Preparation

Input: Accepts a PDF document containing a specified number (X) of Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs).

Parsing: The system must parse the PDF content, identifying the question, the options, and the single correct answer for each MCQ.

Answer Standardization: All numerical answer options (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) must be automatically converted and displayed as standardized string labels (e.g., A, B, C, D) for user interaction.

2. Core Game Modes

The user must be able to select between two modes upon starting the game:

A. Normal Mode

Pace: Standard self-paced study. No timer display or score pressure.

B. Speedrun Mode (Memorization Focus)

Timer: A non-intrusive running clock must be displayed at the top of the screen to track the total time taken to complete all X questions. This timer should not disrupt gameplay.

Goal: Track time to completion for rapid knowledge testing.

3. User Interface & Aesthetics

Visual Theme: Retro Terminal Aesthetic. Use a primary Dark Aesthetic with high-contrast White Font.

Typography: The entire interface must use a Pixel/Monospace Font for a nostalgic, focused feel.

Progress Tracking: A Top Progress Bar must visually represent the player's advancement through the X total questions (e.g., a bar filling up as they proceed).

Theme Toggle: A simple Light Mode / Dark Mode Switch must be placed in the top-right corner of the interface. The dark mode must be the default setting.

4. Gameplay Logic & Feedback

Correct Answer:

Upon clicking the correct option, immediately advance to the next question.

Incorrect Answer:

If the user selects an incorrect option, the system must immediately highlight the correct answer.

Display a small, custom Modal/Pop-up Message providing feedback (e.g., "Incorrect. Review the answer.")

The user must click a 'Next Question' button within the modal to manually proceed to the subsequent question.
